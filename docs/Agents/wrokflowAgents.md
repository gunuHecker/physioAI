Sequential agents¶
The SequentialAgent¶

The SequentialAgent is a workflow agent that executes its sub-agents in the order they are specified in the list.

Use the SequentialAgent when you want the execution to occur in a fixed, strict order.
Example¶

    You want to build an agent that can summarize any webpage, using two tools: Get Page Contents and Summarize Page. Because the agent must always call Get Page Contents before calling Summarize Page (you can't summarize from nothing!), you should build your agent using a SequentialAgent.

As with other workflow agents, the SequentialAgent is not powered by an LLM, and is thus deterministic in how it executes. That being said, workflow agents are concerned only with their execution (i.e. in sequence), and not their internal logic; the tools or sub-agents of a workflow agent may or may not utilize LLMs.
How it works¶

When the SequentialAgent's Run Async method is called, it performs the following actions:

    Iteration: It iterates through the sub agents list in the order they were provided.
    Sub-Agent Execution: For each sub-agent in the list, it calls the sub-agent's Run Async method.

Sequential Agent
Full Example: Code Development Pipeline¶

Consider a simplified code development pipeline:

    Code Writer Agent: An LLM Agent that generates initial code based on a specification.
    Code Reviewer Agent: An LLM Agent that reviews the generated code for errors, style issues, and adherence to best practices. It receives the output of the Code Writer Agent.
    Code Refactorer Agent: An LLM Agent that takes the reviewed code (and the reviewer's comments) and refactors it to improve quality and address issues.

A SequentialAgent is perfect for this:

SequentialAgent(sub_agents=[CodeWriterAgent, CodeReviewerAgent, CodeRefactorerAgent])

This ensures the code is written, then reviewed, and finally refactored, in a strict, dependable order. The output from each sub-agent is passed to the next by storing them in state via Output Key.

Loop agents¶
The LoopAgent¶

The LoopAgent is a workflow agent that executes its sub-agents in a loop (i.e. iteratively). It repeatedly runs a sequence of agents for a specified number of iterations or until a termination condition is met.

Use the LoopAgent when your workflow involves repetition or iterative refinement, such as like revising code.
Example¶

    You want to build an agent that can generate images of food, but sometimes when you want to generate a specific number of items (e.g. 5 bananas), it generates a different number of those items in the image (e.g. an image of 7 bananas). You have two tools: Generate Image, Count Food Items. Because you want to keep generating images until it either correctly generates the specified number of items, or after a certain number of iterations, you should build your agent using a LoopAgent.

As with other workflow agents, the LoopAgent is not powered by an LLM, and is thus deterministic in how it executes. That being said, workflow agents are only concerned only with their execution (i.e. in a loop), and not their internal logic; the tools or sub-agents of a workflow agent may or may not utilize LLMs.
How it Works¶

When the LoopAgent's Run Async method is called, it performs the following actions:

    Sub-Agent Execution: It iterates through the Sub Agents list in order. For each sub-agent, it calls the agent's Run Async method.

    Termination Check:

    Crucially, the LoopAgent itself does not inherently decide when to stop looping. You must implement a termination mechanism to prevent infinite loops. Common strategies include:
        Max Iterations: Set a maximum number of iterations in the LoopAgent. The loop will terminate after that many iterations.
        Escalation from sub-agent: Design one or more sub-agents to evaluate a condition (e.g., "Is the document quality good enough?", "Has a consensus been reached?"). If the condition is met, the sub-agent can signal termination (e.g., by raising a custom event, setting a flag in a shared context, or returning a specific value).

Loop Agent
Full Example: Iterative Document Improvement¶

Imagine a scenario where you want to iteratively improve a document:

    Writer Agent: An LlmAgent that generates or refines a draft on a topic.

    Critic Agent: An LlmAgent that critiques the draft, identifying areas for improvement.

    LoopAgent(sub_agents=[WriterAgent, CriticAgent], max_iterations=5)

In this setup, the LoopAgent would manage the iterative process. The CriticAgent could be designed to return a "STOP" signal when the document reaches a satisfactory quality level, preventing further iterations. Alternatively, the max iterations parameter could be used to limit the process to a fixed number of cycles, or external logic could be implemented to make stop decisions. The loop would run at most five times, ensuring the iterative refinement doesn't continue indefinitely.
